### Added

#### R/Kademlia Conformance - Task 1: RequestContext for Source Routing

- **What**: Created `dht/requestContext.js` with `RequestContext` class for carrying source routing metadata through recursive lookups
- **Why**: R/Kademlia requires recursive routing where intermediate nodes forward requests. The RequestContext enables:
  - Unique lookup identification via `lookupId` for message deduplication
  - Trace path tracking for reverse routing of replies
  - TTL enforcement to prevent unbounded recursion
  - Loop detection via `hasVisited()` method
- **Configuration**: None required - this is a foundational data structure
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - BigInt values must be serialized as strings for JSON wire transport
  - The `forward()` method creates immutable copies to prevent accidental mutation
  - Property-based testing with fast-check validates serialization round-trips across the full 128-bit key space

#### Dependencies

- Added `fast-check` as dev dependency for property-based testing

#### Tests

- Created `spec/rdht/requestContextSpec.js` with:
  - Property test for round-trip serialization (validates Requirements 2.5, 2.6)
  - Unit tests for constructor, forward(), hasVisited(), serialize(), and deserialize()
